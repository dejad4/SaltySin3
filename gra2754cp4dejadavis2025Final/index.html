	<h3>Dumpings</h3>
	<p>INGREDIENTS</p>	 
	<p>Filling</p>
<p>Filling – 30 dumpligs
200 g minced pork, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tbsp scallions or green onions finely chopped, 1 tsp minced ginger, 1/4 tsp ground Sichuan pepper or Chinese five-spice powder, 1 tsp light soy sauce, 1 tsp oyster sauce, 1/2 tsp sesame oil, 5 tbsp water / stock
	300 g celery finely chopped, 10oz, 2 tbsp coriander finely chopped.</p>
<p>Wrapper – 30 dumpling wrappers
Store bought wrappers OR make wrappers from scratch, 210 g all-purpose flour unsifted, ~1.5 cups + more for dusting, 105 ml to 110 ml water room temperature or just boiled hot water*, 1/4 tsp. salt 1g, *Cooler water to make dumpling wrappers for water boiled dumplings. If you want to make steamed dumplings or pot stickers you can use just boiled hot water.
 </p>
		 <p>STEPS</p>
		 <p>Filling</p>
<p>1: Place pork in a mixing bowl. Add scallions/green onions, ginger, 1/4 teaspoon salt, Sichuan pepper / five-spice, soy sauce, oyster sauce and sesame oil.</p>
<p>Gradually add water to the meat while swirling in one direction until no more liquid can be seen.
Add the remaining salt to the celery then leave to rest for 10 minutes. Squeeze out excess liquid then add to the meat. Mix well with coriander.</p>
<p>Wrapper:</p>
<p>1: Mix salt, flour, and water in a bowl, adjust water amount, knead dough for 8-10 minutes, rest 15 minutes, re-knead for 2-3 minutes, and rest for 1 hour.</p>
<p>2: Dig a small hole in the centre of the ball. Shape it to a large circle round. Cut so you will end up a long log.
Shape the log around 3cm in diameter. Divide the long log into small dumpling dough pieces (each around 10g). Dust each of them so they will not stick together.</p>
<p>3: To create dumpling wrappers, dust your work surface, press dough into a disc, rotate, and roll repeatedly. This process will result in thicker centers and thinner edges, which can be difficult at first but is eventually achieved.</p>
<p>4: Dust with flour to prevent sticking, stack and cover with moist paper towel until ready to use.
To make dumplings</p>
<p>5: Scoop a tablespoon of dumpling filling into the center of the wrapper, seal the edges with one hand, and fold again to seal well. The goal is to keep the dumplings intact during cooking. Place the dumplings on a working surface and work on the remaining doughs. Cover and cook until ready.</p>
<p>6: Try to wrap and cook dumplings in small batches (20 to 25 dumplings at a time). If you won’t cook dumplings soon after wrapping (within 30 minutes), freeze them first. If you want to know the reason, read the session of “Things you should take note of” above.</p>
<p>Cook:</p>
<p>Heat a tablespoon of oil in a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. When oil is hot, place potstickers in the skillet, pleat side up.</p>
<p>Swirl 2 tablespoons water in the skillet, cover immediately, and turn the heat to medium. Cook covered until the water is evaporated and potstickers are cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Remove the cover and flip one potsticker to see whether the bottom side is charred. If not, turn to medium high heat and cook until the bottom side turns golden brown.
Transfer the potstickers to a plate.</p>

<h3>Mochi</h3>
<p>INGREDIENTS</p>
<p>1cup mochiko sweet rice flour (glutinous rice flour), 1 cup water, 1⁄4 cup sugar, katakuriko, for dusting (potato starch).</p>
<p>STEPS</p>
<p>1: Mix mochiko and sugar in a bowl.Add water and mix thoroughly. (will be watery).</p>
<p>2: Put in a microwaveable dish. Cover with plastic wrap.
Microwave on high for 4 minutes. Take off plastic wrap. Cool for a few minutes, if you want. Cut. Serve.
Opt. Dust with katakuriko or kinako to prevent mochi from sticking everywhere. If you don't have these, you can just put the mochi on cellophane.</p>
<p>3: Variations for Filling: You can add red bean paste, ice cream, chocolate, etc. in the middle if you want BEFORE you dust. add a teaspoon of filling and pinch edges closed. Variations for Dough: Add a few drops of food coloring into batter for color variation. A few drops of flavoring (strawberry, grape, orange, blueberry, etc.) may also be added. For chocolate flavor, stir about 1/4 cup melted chocolate chips into mochi batter before cooking.</p>
